<h2>WalletPay Payment System</h2>

"WalletPay is a full-stack web application I developed to enable secure and seamless wallet-based transactions. Users can sign up, log in, and manage their wallet balance to make payments. 
The platform also allows users to search for others by name to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions.

For the frontend, I used HTML, CSS, and TypeScript to create a clean, responsive, and type-safe interface. On the backend, I used Node.js and Express.js to handle server-side logic and API requests. I chose MongoDB as the database to securely store user details, wallet balances, and transaction histories.

To ensure security, I implemented password encryption using bcrypt and used JWT for user authentication. Additionally, I focused on optimizing database queries to ensure real-time updates for wallet balances.

This project highlights my ability to design and build a full-stack application, integrate secure payment systems, and leverage TypeScript for a more robust and scalable codebase. Iâ€™d be happy to discuss any specific technical details or challenges I faced during development."
